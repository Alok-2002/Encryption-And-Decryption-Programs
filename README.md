Description



This repository contains a collection of ciphers and encryption applications implemented in Python. The ciphers include classic ciphers like Caesar Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Playfair Cipher, etc. The encryption applications include tools for encryption and decryption of messages, password generators, and more.

Installation
To use the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have installed Python, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Encryption-And-Decryption-Programs.git


 After cloning the repository, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command in the repository directory:
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 Usage
To use the ciphers and encryption applications in this repository, simply run the Python files in the src directory. Each file corresponds to a different cipher or encryption application.

For example, to encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, you can run the following command:

python src/caesar_cipher.py -e "hello world" -k 3

This will encrypt the message "hello world" using the Caesar Cipher with a key of 3. You can find more information about the available options for each cipher or encryption application by running it with the -h or --help option.
